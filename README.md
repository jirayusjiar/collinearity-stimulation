# collinearity-stimulation

Indep: 3 variables (2 highly correlated)
Dep: Generated from linear equation of indep

This piece of code will generate two type of datasets, one will have some highly correlated variables while another has no highly correlated variables. Then, each dataset will be used to build regression model and intepreted.
